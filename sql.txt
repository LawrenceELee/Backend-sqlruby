SELECT with JOIN practice:

Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT OrderID, ProductName, Quantity FROM OrderDetails
INNER JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID
;


Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName, ProductID, Quantity
FROM Employees
INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID
INNER JOIN OrderDetails ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
;


============================================
To see the table schema:

SELECT * from Orders;
Number of Records: 196
OrderID	CustomerID	EmployeeID	OrderDate	ShipperID

SELECT * from OrderDetails;
Number of Records: 518
OrderDetailID	OrderID	ProductID	Quantity

SELECT * from Employees;
Number of Records: 10
EmployeeID	LastName	FirstName	BirthDate	Photo	Notes
